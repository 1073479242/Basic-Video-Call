    This tutorial shows you how to quickly create an open video call using the Agora sample app.

Prerequisites:
  - Node.js 6.9.1+
  - A web server that supports SSL (https)

QuickStart:
  description:
    This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.
  sections:
    - title: Obtain an App ID
      content: |
        To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
        1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/).
        2. In the Dashboard that opens, click **Projects** > **Project List** in the left navigation.
        3. Copy the **App ID** from the Dashboard.
    - title: Install dependencies and integrate the Agora Video SDK
      content: |
        1. Open the **src/utils/Settings.js** file. At the bottom of the file, replace `<#YOUR APP ID#>` with the App ID from the dashboard.

            **Note:** Place the App ID within single or double quotes.

            ```xml
            export const APP_ID = <#YOUR APP ID#>;
            ```

        2. Using the Terminal app, enter the `install` command in your project directory. This command installs libraries that are required to run the sample application.

            ``` bash
            # install dependencies
            npm install
            ```

        3. Start the application by entering the `run dev` or `run build` command.

            The `run dev` command is for development purposes.

            ``` bash
            # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
            npm run dev
            ```

            The `run build` command is for production purposes and minifies code.

            ``` bash
            # build for production with minification
            npm run build
            ```

        4. Your default browser should open and display the sample application, as shown here.

            **Note:** In some cases, you may need to open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` as the URL.
