    The Open Video Call for Android Sample App is an open-source demo that will help you get video chat integrated directly into your Android applications using the Agora Video SDK.
    
    With this sample app, you can:
    - Join / leave channel
    - Mute / unmute audio
    - Enable / disable video
    - Switch camera
    - Send message to channel
    - Setup resolution, frame rate and bit rate
    - Enable encryption
    - Enable / disable black and white filter

Prerequisites:
  - Android Studio 3.3 or above
  - Real devices (Nexus 5X or other devices)
  - Some simulators are function missing or have performance issue, so real device is the best choice

QuickStart:
  description:
    This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.
  sections:
    - title: Obtain an App ID
      content: |
        To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
        1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/).
        2. In the Dashboard that opens, click **Projects** > **Project List** in the left navigation.
        3. Copy the **App ID** from the Dashboard.
        4. Update "app/src/main/res/values/strings_config.xml" with your App ID.
        ```
        <string name="private_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
        ```
    - title: Integrate the Agora Video SDK
      content: |
        There are two ways to integrate:
        - The recommended way to integrate:
          - Add the address which can integrate the Agora Video SDK automatically through JCenter in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":
            
            ```
            implementation 'io.agora.rtc:full-sdk:2.4.0'
            ```

            (Adding the link address is the most important step if you want to integrate the Agora Video SDK in your own application.)
          
          - Download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.h** under **libs/include** to **app/src/main/cpp/agora**.
        - Alternative way to integrate:
          
          - Download the **Agora Video SDK** from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy ***.jar** under **libs** to **app/libs**, **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**, ***.h** under **libs/include** to **app/src/main/cpp/agora**.
          
          - Add the following code in the property of the dependence of the "app/build.gradle":
          
            ```
            compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
            ```
            
    - title: Run the Application
      content: |
        Open project with Android Studio, connect your Android device, build and run.
        
        Or use `Gradle` to build and run.
