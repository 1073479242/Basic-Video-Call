        To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
        1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/).
        2. In the Dashboard that opens, click **Projects** > **Project List** in the left navigation.
        3. Copy the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.
    - title: Integrate the Agora Video SDK
      content: |
        1. Open `OpenVideoCall.xcodeproj` and edit the `KeyCenter.swift` file. In the `agoraKit` declaration, update `<#Your App Id#>` with your app ID.

            ``` Swift
            static let AppId: String = <#Your App Id#>
            ```

        2. Download the [Agora Video SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy the following files from the SDK `libs` folder into the sample application `OpenVideoCall` folder.

            - `AograRtcEngineKit.framework`
            - `AgoraRtcCryptoLoader.framework`
            - `libcrypto.a`
          
        3. Connect your iPhone or iPad device and run the project. Ensure a valid provisioning profile is applied or your project will not run.
